The simplest way to implement a Kubernetes cluster on AWS is to use the EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) managed
service. However, it was found that EKS is expensive, with a starting price that is unrelated to EC2 compute costs,
solely from EKS. To learn (save money), we will use bare EC2 instances to build a Kubernetes cluster and integrate
ArgoCD to achieve CD (Continuous Deployment).

## Prepare EC2 Instances

Create EC2 instances through the AWS console or AWS CLI. Generally, the production environment configuration requires:

| Node Role | vCPU | Memory | Disk Space | Purpose                      |
|-----------|------|--------|------------|------------------------------|
| Master    | 2    | 4GB    | 20GB       | For Kubernetes control-plane |
| Worker    | 1    | 2GB    | 20GB       | For running application Pods |

> **You can also deploy a single-node cluster, with the Master and Worker on the same EC2 instance. This tutorial will
use a single-node deployment to save costs for learning.**

When creating an EC2 instance, select the Amazon Linux xxx AMI.

![Select Amazon Linux AMI](/images/setup-k8s-cluster-in-aws-ec2-without-using-eks/aws-ec2-launch-ami.png "Select Amazon Linux AMI")

Create a key pair to remotely SSH into the EC2 instance. After creation, download a private key file, generally stored
in the `~/.ssh` directory, and change the permissions to read-only for the owner.

```bash
chmod 400 your-private-key.pem
```

After the EC2 instance is created, you can SSH into the instance using the following command:

```bash
ssh -i your-private-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
```

After that, we need to install the necessary software on the EC2 instance. Firstly, update the `dnf` package manager.
Since we are using the Amazon Linux 2 AMI, we use the `dnf` package manager instead of `yum`.

```bash
sudo dnf update -y
```

## Prepare Containerd

### Installation

```bash
sudo dnf install -y containerd
```

### Enabling

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now containerd
```

### Configuring

```bash
sudo containerd config default | sudo tee /etc/containerd/config.toml
```

Edit the `/etc/containerd/config.toml` file to change `systemd_cgroup = false` to `systemd_cgroup = true` to make
containerd use the systemd cgroup driver.

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/SystemdCgroup = false/SystemdCgroup = true/' /etc/containerd/config.toml
```

Restart the containerd service and check the status.

```bash
sudo systemctl restart containerd  
sudo systemctl status containerd
```

## Prepare CNI

The `CNI` (`Container Network Interface`) plugin provides network functionality for Kubernetes. It is mainly responsible
for:

1. Assigning an IP address to the `Pod`.
2. Setting up network communication between containers.
3. Ensuring that the `Pod` can communicate with other `Pod`s, services (`Service`s), and the outside world.

If the `CNI` plugin is not installed and configured correctly, the `Pod` network of `Kubernetes` will not work properly,
causing the `Pod` to be unable to communicate with each other or to assign an IP address. First, check if the `CNI`
plugin is installed.

```bash
ls /opt/cni/bin
```

If the above command does not output the following information, it means that the `CNI` plugin is not installed.

```
ls: cannot access '/opt/cni/bin': No such file or directory
```

Install the `CNI` plugin by running the following command.

```bash
CNI_VERSION=1.4.0
sudo wget -P /usr/local/src https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins/releases/download/v${CNI_VERSION}/cni-plugins-linux-amd64-v${CNI_VERSION}.tgz
sudo mkdir -p /opt/cni/bin
sudo tar -C /opt/cni/bin -xf /usr/local/src/cni-plugins-linux-amd64-v${CNI_VERSION}.tgz
```

After installation, use the `ls /opt/cni/bin` command to check. You should see the following output.

```
bandwidth  bridge  dhcp  dummy  firewall  flannel  host-device  host-local
ipvlan  loopback  macvlan  portmap  ptp  sbr  static  tap  tuning  vlan  vrf
```

## Other Necessary Configurations

### Start Two Kernel Modules

```bash
sudo modprobe overlay  
sudo modprobe br_netfilter
```

> `overlay` and `br_netfilter` are two kernel modules required by the `Kubernetes` cluster and need to be loaded manually.

To automatically load these two modules when the system starts, edit the `/etc/modules-load.d/k8s.conf` file.

```bash
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/k8s.conf
overlay
br_netfilter
EOF
```

Check if the modules are loaded successfully.

```bash
lsmod | grep -e overlay -e br_netfilter
```

### Modify `sysctl` Configuration

```bash
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables = 1
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
EOF
```

> This operation is needed to ensure the `iptables` works correctly.

Refresh the `sysctl` configuration to take effect.

```bash
sudo sysctl --system
```

### Disable `swap`

```bash
sudo swapon -s # 查看 swap 分区
sudo swapoff -a
```

> The reason is that `Kubernetes` does not support swap partitions because swap partitions make the memory limit of the `Pod` invalid.

## Install Kubernetes

### Install `curl`

```bash
sudo dnf install -y curl
```

> Skip this step if you already have `curl`.

### Add the `Kubernetes` Repository

Add the `Kubernetes` repository address to the `/etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo` file using the following command.

```bash
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/kubernetes.repo
[kubernetes]
name=Kubernetes
baseurl=https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.28/rpm/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.28/rpm/repodata/repomd.xml.key
exclude=kubelet kubeadm kubectl cri-tools kubernetes-cni
EOF
```

> At the time of this writing, we use the `v1.28` version of `Kubernetes`.

Update the package manager to recognize the new repository.

```bash
sudo dnf makecache
```

### Installation

Install `kubeadm`, `kubelet`, and `kubectl` and start the `kubelet` service.

```bash
sudo dnf install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl --disableexcludes=kubernetes
sudo systemctl enable --now kubelet
```

> The `kubelet` service is one of the main components of `Kubernetes`, responsible for managing the lifecycle of `Pod`s,
>
> `kubeadm` is the initialization tool for `Kubernetes`, which helps us quickly initialize a `Kubernetes` cluster.
>
> `kubectl` is the command-line tool for `Kubernetes` to interact with the `Kubernetes` cluster.

Install the `tc (Traffic Control)` package to ensure that the `Kubernetes` cluster works properly. First, check the package that contains the `tc` package.

```bash
dnf provides tc
```

The `tc` package is generally in the `iproute-tc` package, so install the `iproute-tc` package therefor.

```bash
sudo dnf install -y iproute-tc
```

### Initialize the `Kubernetes` Cluster

Initialize the `Kubernetes` cluster using `kubeadm`.

```bash
sudo kubeadm init --pod-network-cidr=10.244.0.0/16
```

> Be sure to use `sudo` to execute the `kubeadm init` command because this command will modify the system configuration files, otherwise an error will occur.
>
> Here, the `CIDR` uses `10.244.0.0/16` because the network plugin `Flannel` configured later defaults to this `CIDR`.


After the initialization is complete, you will see information similar to the following, with two commands, one is the `kubeadm join` command, and the other is the `kubectl apply` command, used to join the node and install the network plugin, respectively.

```
Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!
```

### Check the `kubelet` Service Status

```bash
systemctl status kubelet
```

You should get the following output, the `kubelet` service should be `Active: active (running)`.

```
● kubelet.service - Kubernetes Kubelet
   Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/kubelet.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
   Active: active (running) since Fri 2024-11-22 09:00:00 UTC; 1min 30s ago

```

Copy the `kubectl` configuration file to the current user's home directory.

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
```

## Install the CNI plugin

We will use the `Flannel` as the `CNI` network plugin. `Flannel` is a simple `Kubernetes` network solution that assigns a unique `IP` address to each `Pod` and ensures that `Pod`s on different nodes can communicate through a virtual network.

### Deploy `Flannel`

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flannel-io/flannel/master/Documentation/kube-flannel.yml
```

### Check the `Pod` Status

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-flannel
```

You should get the following output, the `Pod` of `Flannel` should be in the `Running` state.

```
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS       AGE
kube-flannel-ds-n2nzv   1/1     Running   20 (52s ago)   67m
```

And check the `Flannel DaemonSet` with the following command.

```bash
kubectl get daemonset kube-flannel-ds -n kube-flannel
```

You should get the following output, the `AVAILABLE` column should be `1`.

```
NAME             DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR            AGE
kube-flannel-ds  1         1         1       1            1           <none>                   67m
```

Check the `Pod` of the `kube-system` Namespace

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system
```

You should get the following output, all `Pod`s should be in the `Running` state. If there are `ContainerCreating` states, wait a moment before checking again.

```
NAME                                                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

kube-scheduler-ip-123-12-12-12.ap-northeast-1.compute.internal            1/1     Running   0          70m
```

Check the Node Status

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

You should get the following output.

```
NAME                                              STATUS   ROLES           AGE   VERSION
ip-123-12-12-12.ap-northeast-1.compute.internal   Ready    control-plane   72m   v1.28.0
```

## Install `Metrics Server` (Optional)

`Metrics Server` is an aggregator for `Kubernetes` that collects resource usage in the cluster. With `Metrics Server`, you can use the `kubectl top` command to view real-time resource usage in the cluster. First, deploy it.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server/releases/latest/download/components.yaml
``` 

Edit the `Metrics Server` `Deployment` to add the `--kubelet-insecure-tls` parameter.

```bash
kubectl edit deployment metrics-server -n kube-system
```

Find the `args` field under `containers` and add the `--kubelet-insecure-tls` parameter, as follows. Save and exit, and the `Deployment` will be automatically updated.

```yaml
containers:
  - args:
      - --kubelet-insecure-tls
```

> The reason for this operation is that `Metrics Server` uses a self-signed certificate by default, and the `Kubernetes` API Server may refuse to communicate with it.

Check the `Metrics Server` Status

```bash
kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep metrics-server
```

You should get the following output, the `Pod` of `metrics-server` should be in the `Running` state.

```
metrics-server-6d4c8c5f99-7z5zv   1/1     Running   0          3m
```

Then you can use the `kubectl top` command to view the real-time resource usage in the cluster.

```bash
kubectl top nodes
kubectl top pods -n <namespace>
```

## Integrate `ArgoCD`

`ArgoCD` is a tool for `GitOps` deployment, which helps us store application configuration files in a `Git` repository and automatically synchronize them to the `Kubernetes` cluster through `ArgoCD`.

### Create a Namespace

```bash
kubectl create namespace argocd
```

### Install `ArgoCD`

```bash
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

If it is a single-node cluster, the `control-plane` node also needs to run normal `Pod`s, that is, `ArgoCD` related `Pod`s. However, the `control-plane` node generally has a `node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane` taint, which prevents normal `Pod`s from being scheduled to the `control-plane` node. Here is a quick solution for testing, which is to remove the taint on the `control-plane` node so that it can run normal `Pod`s.

```bash
kubectl taint nodes --all node-role.kubernetes.io/control-plane-
```

### Check the `Pod` Status

```bash
kubectl get pods -n argocd
```

All `Pod`s should be in the `Running` state. If there are `Pod`s in the `ContainerCreating` or `Init` state, wait a moment before checking again.

```
NAME                                                READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
argocd-application-controller-0                     1/1     Running   0          6m14s
argocd-applicationset-controller-84c66c76b4-zf6bd   1/1     Running   0          6m15s
argocd-dex-server-97fdcf666-4pbwc                   1/1     Running   0          6m15s
argocd-notifications-controller-7c44dd7757-2twjj    1/1     Running   0          6m15s
argocd-redis-596f8956cc-wf6md                       1/1     Running   0          6m15s
argocd-repo-server-577664cf68-ngbcz                 1/1     Running   0          6m15s
argocd-server-6b9b64c5fb-qtk6b                      1/1     Running   0          6m15s
```

### Expose the `ArgoCD Server`

```bash
kubectl patch svc argocd-server -n argocd -p '{"spec": {"type": "NodePort"}}'
```

Check the `ArgoCD Server` `NodePort` Port

```bash
kubectl get svc argocd-server -n argocd
```

You should get the following output.

```
NAME            TYPE       CLUSTER-IP    EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
argocd-server   NodePort   10.97.82.16   <none>        80:31027/TCP,443:32130/TCP   14m
```

> Where `80:31027/TCP` is the `HTTP` port, and `443:32130/TCP` is the `HTTPS` port. You can access the `ArgoCD` UI via `http://<control-plane-ip>:31027`.

Get the public `IP` address of the `control-plane` node and then access `http://<control-plane-ip>:31027`. For `AWS EC2` instances, you can view it in the `AWS` console.

![ArgoCD Login Page](/images/setup-k8s-cluster-in-aws-ec2-without-using-eks/argocd-login-page.png "ArgoCD Login Page")

### Get the Initial Password of the `ArgoCD Server`

```bash
kubectl get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -n argocd -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d
```

> The username is `admin`, and the password is the output of the above command. It is recommended to change the administrator password immediately after logging in.

### Install the `ArgoCD CLI`

To integrate with `CI` for automated deployment, the `ArgoCD CLI` (command-line tool) is essential.

#### Download

```bash
curl -sSL -o argocd https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases/latest/download/argocd-linux-amd64
```

### Assign Execution Permissions

```bash
chmod +x argocd
```

### Move the Executable File

Move `argocd` to the `/usr/local/bin` directory.

```bash
sudo mv ./argocd /usr/local/bin
```

### Verify Installation

```bash
argocd version
```

### Configuration the `ArgoCD CLI`

```bash
argocd login <ARGOCD_SERVER> --username admin --password <YOUR_PASSWORD> --insecure
```

> `ARGOCD_SERVER` is the address of the `ArgoCD` server, and `YOUR_PASSWORD` is the password of the `ArgoCD` administrator.
>
> The `--insecure` parameter is because `ArgoCD` defaults to using a self-signed certificate, and the `ArgoCD CLI` may refuse to communicate with it.

### Verify Connection

```bash
argocd app list
```

So far, the deployment and integration of `Kubernetes` and `ArgoCD` have been completed, and you can start deploying applications.

Because `ArgoCD` is only responsible for the `CD` part (obviously), the application packaging and building are still not automated. Especially for preview and test environments, we usually want to have real-time builds and deployments. Therefore, we still need to build a `CI` environment.

Please refer to the next post: [Setup Jenkins in AWS EC2](/posts/setup-jenkins-in-aws-ec2) for the deployment of `Jenkins` in `AWS EC2`.
