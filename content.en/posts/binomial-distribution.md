The binomial distribution is the foundation of almost everything, describing the probability distribution of the number of successes \(k\) in \(n\) independent repeated experiments (Bernoulli trials).

## Definition
For \(X ~ B(n, p)\), i.e., the parameter follows a binomial distribution with \(n\) trials and success probability \(p\), the probability mass function is:

$$
P(X=k) = C(n, k) \cdot p^k \cdot (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

## Repeated Independent Trials (Bernoulli Trials)

It is a random experiment with only two results, such as flipping a coin, either heads or tails, either win or lose. And the probability of success is the same each time, i.e., the previous one does not affect the next one.

## Probability Mass Function (PMF)

_The Probability Mass Function (PMF) is the probability of a discrete random variable at each value_. The sum of all values is 1.

$$
\sum_{x=0}^{n} P(X) = 1\
$$

## Derivation

The success probability is \(p\), the failure probability is \(1-p\), and now we do \(n\) trials.

The probability of all successes is:

$$
P(X=n) = p^n
$$

The probability of all failures (i.e., the number of successes is \(0\)) is:

$$
P(X=0) = (1-p)^n
$$

The probability of succeeding \(1\) time is to select 1 success from \(n\) trials.

$$
P(X=1) = C(n, 1) \cdot p \cdot (1-p)^{n-1}
$$

So the probability of succeeding \(k\) times is to select \(k\) successes from \(n\) trials.

$$
P(X=k) = C(n, k) \cdot p^k \cdot (1-p)^{n-k}
$$

> The combination used above is the total number of ways to select \(k\) elements from \(n\) elements, denoted as \(C(n, k)\).

$$
C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
$$

For example, selecting \(1\) from \(n\) elements obviously has \(n\) ways, i.e., \(C(n, 1) = n\).

## Expectation (Average Number of Successes)

Intuitively, the number of experiments multiplied by the probability of success is the expected value. Why? For a single Bernoulli experiment, i.e., the expected value of each \(X_i\) is \(p\). Because either success or failure:

$$
E(X_i) = 1 \cdot p + 0 \cdot (1-p) = p
$$

By using the linearity of expectation, the expected value of \(n\) experiments is \(np\).

$$
E(X) = E(\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} E(X_i) = np
$$

## Variance

Variance describes the degree of fluctuation of the number of successes around the expected value \(np\), _defined as the mean of the square of the differences between each data point and the mean_.

$$
Var(X) = E[(X - E[X])^2]
$$

When expanded, we get the following formula, which is easier to derive the variance of the binomial distribution. (See previous: [Understanding Variance](/posts/understand-math-variance/))

$$
Var(X) = E(X^2) - E(X)^2
$$

The variance of the binomial distribution is:

$$
Var(X ~ B(n, p)) = np(1-p)
$$

Why? For a single Bernoulli variable (the result of a single Bernoulli experiment) because \(X_i\) can only be \(0\) or \(1\), so:

$$
X_i^2 = X_i
$$

> This can be verified by substituting \(X_i = 0\) and \(X_i = 1\).

So

$$
E(X_i^2) = E(X_i) = p
$$

Since the expectation of a single variable is known, i.e., \(E(X_i) = p\), the variance of a single variable is:

$$
Var(X_i) = E(X_i^2) - E(X_i)^2 = p - p^2 = p(1-p)
$$

By using the linearity of variance, the variance of \(n\) experiments is:

$$
Var(X) = Var(\sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} Var(X_i) = np(1-p)
$$

## Intuition of Variance

An important intuition is that because there is \(p(1-p)\), when \(p = 0.5\), the variance is the largest. Obviously, the uncertainty represented by a 50% success rate is the highest. Similarly, in a rectangle with a fixed perimeter, the area of a square is the largest.

![square-area](/images/binomial-distribution/square-area.png "square-area")

If the success rate is 0% or 100%, there will be no fluctuation, i.e., a certain event, no randomness, so the variance is 0. That is, the rectangle has one side of zero, and the area is also zero.

## Standard Deviation

The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. So obviously:
$$
\sigma = \sqrt{np(1-p)}
$$
