Human nature is something to be utilized, not resisted. Even apparent opposition is merely another form of leverage. This is akin to how we harness water, electricity, or coal—not by fighting their essence but by channelling their forces. Especially for adults, genuine change rarely stems from another’s will; it occurs only when profound pain disrupts their mental and physical state.

_Reason Is—and Can Only Be—the Servant of Passion_

This principle applies universally, including to ourselves. Fighting against human nature is to fracture one's own integrity. Everyone has an innate, genuine response to situations—a symphony composed of genetics and early experiences. Ignoring or disrespecting this natural reaction turns a person into something unnatural, a misfit. That is the greatest tragedy of all. Even acknowledging a flawed nature is better than masking or denying it.

True reason serves emotion. If you feel uneasy, it’s a sign something is amiss, even if you cannot pinpoint what. Do not doubt yourself or waste energy in self-inflicted conflict. Trust your intuition—it’s a signal from your body, an irreplaceable gift that ensures you live in alignment with your intrinsic nature. Within the boundaries of law, act according to your desires. You need neither permission nor approval from others.

## Right and Wrong in Relationships

The concept of right and wrong is largely irrelevant in almost all relationships. What feels "right" is contingent on the person, time, and context. Change the situation, the individual, or the timing, and what was once right may turn completely wrong.

Every decision must serve a purpose. Without purpose, so-called values lack foundation. And whose purpose should a decision ultimately serve, if not your own? In practice, much of what we do is influenced by others’ preferences, but this is sustainable only when it doesn’t contradict our own. Otherwise, dissatisfaction is inevitable. To avoid becoming a distorted version of yourself—or forcing others into that role—you must approach human nature as precisely and logically as one approaches mathematics.

## Judgment Is Rooted in Personal Preference

Nearly all judgments boil down to personal likes and dislikes. There is no absolute “why,” no intrinsic right or wrong.

Do not fear selfishness or the accusations of selfishness from others. They, too, act out of self-interest—often even more so. The world is like an immense game room; you are already inside. There is no way to leave. Everyone plays by their preferences. Shifts in fortune and power may create the illusion that some people are more “right” than others. Do not be fooled by this illusion. In a world without inherent right or wrong, the key is to avoid complacency, remain diligent, and never allow yourself to be weak. Physical frailty may not determine failure, but weakness in intellect or resolve will lead to total loss.
