In Chinese, there is a word "懂事" (dǒng shì), which means sensible, obedient, and mature.

But I want to tell you my friends, whoever tells us to be sensible, we tell them to get lost. Whoever tells us to be obedient, they are our enemies.

To be sensible is to tell us to conform to the framework of others, and to be sensible is to be tamed. _Remember, friends, we don't need to conform to anyone's framework, and if we do, others must sacrifice the same to adapt to our framework._

No one's framework is correct, and no one's framework is superior to others. There is no correct or wrong in most things in life. Everyone is just following the signals of their bodies, acting according to their likes and dislikes, instigating others to follow their likes and dislikes, or flexibly select the parts of customs that are beneficial to them. Why do this? Just because it makes them happy, they won't suffer any loss, or it will be beneficial, there are countless reasons behind it that you don't know.

Whoever tells us to be sensible is making us adapt to their framework. In that framework, our behavior conforms to the other's cognition, likes and dislikes. As a reward, we get recognition, even merely from our perspective. This is absurd, because we don't need, and shouldn't recognize, the recognition of the person who makes us sensible. _Just ask what can I get? Listen to what the other person says, if they offer nothing, it is just one-sided exploitation, then they are our enemies._

As for my children, when they are young, there are basic rules that I need to guard and guide them to follow, just like learning the universal gravitation of nature and human society. These rules are used to ensure safety and maximize happiness, such as how to deal with danger, how to get along with others peacefully and equally. In addition, they should act according to their greatest instincts. Instincts will tell them what is exciting, happy, frustrating, angry, sad, and depressed, and they will learn the essence of life in these emotions and find their best posture.

We have found our best posture, even if it is not the best, our body will tell us. No one has the right to tell us whether our current posture is good or bad, because first, it is none of their business, and second, it is only absolute to their advantage, and whether it is beneficial to us can only be seen in the situation.

To be tamed is a process of suppressing oneself, people will be distorted, become a strange object, a puppet, a dog.
